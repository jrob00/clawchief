# TOOLS.md - Local Notes

Skills define _how_ tools work. This file is for _your_ specifics — the stuff that's unique to your setup.

## What Goes Here

Things like:

- Camera names and locations
- SSH hosts and aliases
- Preferred voices for TTS
- Speaker/room names
- Device nicknames
- Anything environment-specific

## Examples

```markdown
### Cameras

- living-room → Main area, 180° wide angle
- front-door → Entrance, motion-triggered

### SSH

- home-server → 192.168.1.100, user: admin

### TTS

- Preferred voice: "Nova" (warm, slightly British)
- Default speaker: Kitchen HomePod
```

## Linear

- Linear MCP is configured via `mcporter` in `config/mcporter.json` as server `linear`.
- Auth header uses `Authorization: Bearer ${LINEAR_API_KEY}` and expects `LINEAR_API_KEY` in `~/.openclaw/.env`.
- For ad hoc calls, prefix shell commands with `set -a; source ~/.openclaw/.env; set +a;` so header substitution works.
- Common call pattern:
  - `mcporter call linear.save_issue --args '{"title":"...","team":"{{BUSINESS_NAME}}","description":"..."}'`

## Outreach tracking

- For {{OWNER_NAME}}'s outreach / lead-tracking work, the Google Sheet is the only source of truth.
- Do not treat local `.md` or `.csv` prospect files as the live outreach list unless {{OWNER_NAME}} explicitly asks for an export or backup.
- If a lead is added or updated, update the Google Sheet rather than only changing workspace files.
- On this Mac, prefer the local `gws` CLI for Google Sheets work when available; `{{ASSISTANT_EMAIL}}` is already authenticated with Sheets access.
- More broadly for Google Workspace tasks (Sheets/Gmail/Calendar/Docs), prefer `gws` on this machine rather than browser automation when `gws` can do the job.
- For LinkedIn investigation / outreach browser work, prefer the OpenClaw-managed browser profile (`openclaw`) now that {{OWNER_NAME}} has logged LinkedIn into it. Treat personal Chrome attach (`profile=user`) as fallback-only when {{OWNER_NAME}} is physically present and explicitly wants reuse of his live browser session.

## Email / Gmail

- The founder's default work email / cc for chief-of-staff communication is `{{PRIMARY_WORK_EMAIL}}`.
- Use `{{PERSONAL_EMAIL}}` only for personal matters.
- For outbound outreach sent via `gws gmail +send`, keep emails in plain text unless rich formatting is specifically needed.
- `gws gmail +send` plain text is sent as normal `text/plain`; if a mobile client looks awkward, the fix is usually shorter paragraphs and cleaner bulleting, not HTML.
- For plain-text outreach, prefer:
  - one short sentence per paragraph when possible
  - short bullet lists
  - fewer long compound sentences
  - cleaner spacing so mobile wrap looks natural
- When mentioning {{BUSINESS_NAME}} for the first time in an outbound email, write `{{BUSINESS_URL}}` so the recipient's client auto-links it; don't bother with `https://`.
- In first-contact outreach, skip the self-introduction fluff and get to the point. Preferred pattern: a simple greeting, then "I'm on the team at {{BUSINESS_URL}}..." rather than "I'm {{ASSISTANT_NAME}}, {{OWNER_NAME}}'s assistant..."
- Use this default signature for outbound {{BUSINESS_NAME}} emails unless {{OWNER_NAME}} specifies otherwise:

  [farewell greeting],
  {{ASSISTANT_NAME}}

  AI Assistant to {{OWNER_NAME}} (Founder)
  {{BUSINESS_URL}} - replace this line with your business one-liner.
- In scheduling and follow-up threads, read the full thread context before asking for contact details or next-step info. If a person was already copied or identified earlier in the thread, use that context instead of asking {{OWNER_NAME}} to repeat it.
- When replying to an email thread where copied recipients matter, do not assume `--thread-id ... --reply-all` will preserve earlier recipients. Prefer replying against the original message id with `--reply-to-message-id ... --reply-all`, or otherwise verify recipients before sending.
- For outbound {{BUSINESS_NAME}} work email sent by {{ASSISTANT_NAME}}, cc {{OWNER_NAME}} by default unless he says otherwise. Use `{{PRIMARY_WORK_EMAIL}}` as the default cc address.
- Do not write email language that implies {{ASSISTANT_NAME}} is human or personally attended an interaction. Avoid lines like `nice to meet you`, `great seeing you`, or `I enjoyed speaking today` unless the sentence is explicitly about {{OWNER_NAME}}'s experience rather than mine. Prefer neutral phrasing like `Thanks for meeting with {{OWNER_NAME}} today`.

## Why Separate?

Skills are shared. Your setup is yours. Keeping them apart means you can update skills without losing your notes, and share skills without leaking your infrastructure.

Add whatever helps you do your job. This is your cheat sheet.
