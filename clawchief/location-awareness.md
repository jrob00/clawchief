# Location Awareness

Status: v1
Created: 2026-04-06
Purpose: make clawchief location-aware so Ryan's task list, reminders, and appointment triage reflect where he physically is and whether a task is actually doable from that place.

## Ownership boundary

This file owns:
- place-based actionability
- travel-aware task interpretation
- location constraints that affect scheduling or task visibility

This file does not own:
- urgency ranking
- task-system schema
- inbox reply procedure
- meeting-note ingestion

## Core principle

Do not present a task as actionable if Ryan cannot physically do it from his current location.

Location is part of task context, not a nice-to-have.
A good daily plan should distinguish between:
- can do anywhere
- can do while traveling
- requires being at home in Essex
- requires being at a specific appointment location
- can be delegated by R2

## Current known anchor

- Some recurring tasks may be inherently home-based.
- Tasks involving in-person household or pet care should default to the principal's home base unless a different caregiver or location is explicitly noted.

## Operating rules

1. When Ryan is traveling, suppress or reframe home-only tasks as blocked, delegated, or rescheduled instead of showing them as normal active tasks.
2. When a task clearly depends on a place, add the location constraint into the task text.
3. When an appointment or meeting is time-bound and location-bound, preserve both in the task text when known.
4. If Ryan's travel status creates a conflict with an existing task, update the Todoist task in the same turn.
5. If a task is still important but cannot be done from Ryan's current location, choose one of these states:
   - blocked while traveling
   - delegate to someone else
   - reschedule to the next plausible date/location window
6. Prefer specific language over implicit assumptions. Example: "blocked while Ryan is traveling; home task in Essex" is better than silently leaving the task open.
7. Use calendar/travel context plus explicit statements from Ryan as the source of truth for current location assumptions.
8. For scheduling decisions, the Family calendar under `ryan@ryancarson.com` is a required travel source of truth, not optional supporting context.
9. If location is uncertain and it changes whether the task is actionable or whether Ryan can take a meeting, ask or mark the assumption clearly and do not book.

## Integration points

- Todoist task wording, section, due date, and labels should reflect location constraints when relevant.
- `clawchief/priority-map.md` already treats travel and schedule integrity as priority context.
- `daily-task-prep` should use this rule when curating Todoist `Today`.
- Heartbeat check-ins should avoid nudging Ryan about tasks he cannot physically do from where he is.
- The executive-assistant workflow should use this rule before offering times or treating travel windows as available.

## Examples

- "Brush Brinkley's teeth" while Ryan is in Denver -> move out of `Today`, mark blocked while traveling, and make the Essex/home constraint visible.
- "Phone call with sisters" while traveling -> still actionable because location does not block it.
- "Untangle Intro Call" while traveling -> still actionable unless travel logistics or time zone conflict interfere.
- "Check Newsworthy" while traveling -> still actionable if it can be done online.

## Follow-through

When a new recurring place-based pattern appears, compile it into clawchief instead of relying on chat memory.
